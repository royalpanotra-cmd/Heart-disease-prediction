Project Objective

The objective of this project is to predict whether a person may have heart disease based on basic medical details entered by the user through a website.

This project is developed only for educational and academic purposes to demonstrate the use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in the healthcare domain.

⸻

Functional Requirements
	1.	The website should allow the user to enter patient medical information.
	2.	The system should analyze the input data using a machine learning model.
	3.	The website should display the prediction result as either:
Heart Disease Detected
No Heart Disease

⸻

Input Parameters

The system takes the following medical parameters as input:

Age
Gender
Chest Pain Type
Resting Blood Pressure
Cholesterol Level
Fasting Blood Sugar
ECG Result
Maximum Heart Rate
Exercise Induced Angina
Oldpeak
Slope
CA
Thal
